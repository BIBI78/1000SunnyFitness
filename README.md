# ABOUT  # 
* This is basically a simple fitness app. I wanted to create something "useful" that people can actually use. It seems lately these kind of apps are all the rage so I decided to test my metal and see if I could make something work. Ive been re-reading One Piece so  I wanted to the give the user the impression that they are joing a Gym on a pirate ship for no other reason than it gave me sopmething to visualize in my mind and made it easier to work with. So welcome abaord the Thousand Sunny.

# Features # 
* * weight change function
* In this app I do some basic calculations on the user's height, weight , age etc and things like that to give them information and estimation on their fitness gols.  
I calculate the amount of calories they should consume each day and for how many days to get to their goal.


## Workout 
* I give the user the option of getting a workout plan for the week. I suggest the types of workouts depending on their fitness goals , that is to say , gain muscle or lose weight .

## Activity Factor
* With this function I take into account  how many days if any the user has chosen to workout and do a little calculation and give the user the nuber of claories they should eat extra due to workout.

* Meals
* I do something very similar for the meal funtion. I give the user the option to choose a weekly meal plan according to their preferecnes.
* I tried to give a decent variety of options, vegan , halal , gluten free, then whatever ( which is a mix of everything , I want this app to feel human and this is how I talk and I am human, also I want to create things that I would use and would like to see, programs that are more fluid and direct instead of the feeling that you are being used and the creator just wants your money.)  
## Clear Terminal 
* kinda works

## WHILE LOOPS
* Theres a bunch of while loops , i should explain those.



# ERRROR CHECKING AND VALIDATION
* This project in its own way could be seen as an exercise in error handling and validation. Every question to the user is handled and validated ( essentially I make sure all the information I get from the user is legit. ) Doing this took up most of my time and mental ability.
## add image ??
* every step of the way , pretty my this whole project is an exrcise in error handling and validation

# Bugs # 
* There were alot of bugs ohlalala.


# Problems
* I have hard time storing variables , Super hard time, taking info from other fucntions then using it or displaying it somehwere else. its tricky.


# NOTES # 
* The more I worked on this project the more I have learned to do things better and differntly as I progressed towards the end. It seems like theres a never-ending " better way" to do things in python. Once I solved a problem, left it and then came back to copy the function or whatever it was, to use it somewhere else I had found a better way to write the code. I could rewrite the code in this project over and over in endlessly different ways but that wouldnt get me anywhere so Ive settled for what Ive submitted here. Trying to make things work a "certain" way(thats to say how I saw them working in the narrow visoion of myminds eye) all the time was totally at my disadvatge. The problems, the way in which they arose and were eventually solved give my project flexibilty , which , from what Ive learned is more important than perfection.
