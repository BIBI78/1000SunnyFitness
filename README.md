1000 SUNNY FITNESS PROTOTYPE 

# THIS IS MY PROTOTYPE FITNESS APP #
 * The app asks if youd like gain or lose wight then takes questions from the user accordingly to help give suggestions on how to achieve weight goal

 # 1000 Sunny Fitness
 * This is a fitness app in the style of my favorite fictional pirate ship, 1000 Sunny.

 # SO FAR...
 * so far I ask the user for basic info then i do a calculation for weigh gain or loss 
 # CREDITS 
 * I used code i got online and from the project 3 love sandwiches lesson

 # NOTES 
 * The more I worked on this project the more I have learned to do things better and differntly as I progressed towards the end.  It seems like theres a never-ending " better way" to do things in python. Once I solved a problem, left it and then came back to copy the function or whatever it was, to use it somewhere else I had found a better way to write the code. I could rewrite the code in this project over and over in endlessly different ways but that wouldnt get me anywhere so Ive settled for what Ive submitted here. Trying to make things work a "certain" way(thats to say how I saw them working in the narrow visoion of myminds eye) all the time was totally at my disadvatge. The problems, the way in which they arose and were eventually solved give my project flexibilty , which , from what Ive learned is more important than perfection.
